This repo contains the bash script that was used for MRI preprocessing for MVLSM analyses. 
In this script delineated tumor volumes were co-registered with a CT scan, which were CT scans were then reversely linearly registered (rigid transformation) to the post-contrast T1w MRI scan. 
Second, skull stripping was applied to the T1w scans, of which the skull-stripped images were non-linearly registered to the ICBM-MNI template, together with the tumor volumes. 
All registrations were performed using Advanced Normalization Tools. Once all GTVs were in template space, voxel-wise statistics were performed using the MVLSM toolbox.
